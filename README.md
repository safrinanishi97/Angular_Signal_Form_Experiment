A login authentication UI built using Angular Signals and a signal-driven form architecture without Reactive Forms.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Angular (Latest Version)
- Standalone Components
- Angular Signals
- Signal-based Form API
- TypeScript

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project explores how Angular Signals can be used to manage form state and validation without relying on Reactive Forms or RxJS-heavy patterns.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The purpose of this project is to explore and implement authentication UI 
using Angular Signals instead of traditional Reactive Forms.

It focuses on:

- Signal-driven form state
- Declarative validation logic
- Minimal RxJS usage
- Clean component architecture
- Modern Angular patterns

---

## ✨ Features

- Signal-based login form
- Real-time validation
<!-- - Derived state using computed() -->
- Clean separation of UI and logic
- Standalone component architecture
- No Reactive Forms dependency

---

## 🏗 Architecture Highlights

- `signal()` for input state
<!-- - Computed signals for derived validation state -->
- Standalone component design
- Scalable folder structure
- Stateless UI binding
